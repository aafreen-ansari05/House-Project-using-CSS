# Draw House Using HTML and CSS

I have drawn a house using HTML and CSS. HTML is used to structure the page and CSS is to design the look, feel, and color of the page.

Some CSS elements which had played main role in building in this house are - **position**, **z-index**,   **transform**, **border-left, border-right, border-bottom, border-top**, **:after, :before**.
